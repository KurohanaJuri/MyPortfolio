    <h2>Building ChmolChef: Solving Our Friday-Night Dinner Dilemma</h2>
<p>Since my fiancé and I started living together, grocery shopping sessions have become… a little tiring. Doing the groceries on a Friday evening, after a long week of work, is definitely not the most romantic date night we could imagine. Between the crowded aisles, long queues, and the never-ending discussion of “What do you want to eat?”, it often feels more like an endurance test than a simple errand.</p>
<p>The issue isn’t that we don’t know how to cook, it’s deciding <em>what</em> to cook. We’re an international couple, we have plenty of recipes idea, cooking is our way to share love. But the more options you have, the harder it gets to choose. Do we go for a comforting soup noodle, a good steak to celebrate the week-end, or try something completely new? These repeated indecisions made me realize we needed a solution, because indecisive, we certainly are.</p>
<p>As a developer, I saw this problem as more than just a kitchen dilemma. What if I could build a tool to make meal planning easier, inspire our cooking choices, and even simplify grocery shopping?</p>
<p>That’s how this side project began: a small app that serves as a digital cookbook with key features designed for real-life cooking challenges. It includes a “Tinder-style” inspiration system, where you swipe left or right on recipes, a shopping list generator, and a meal planner. Instead of standing in the aisles debating what to cook, we can now quickly get ideas, plan meals ahead, and shop with purpose.</p>
<p>The app is still a work in progress, with several ideas for future improvements. These enhancements will make it even more useful in daily life, keeping it playful and practical while helping anyone plan meals more easily.</p>
